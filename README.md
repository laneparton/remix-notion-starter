# remix-notion-starter
A starter for building a Remix.run website with Notion.
## Overview
In an attempt to learn more about Remix, I started building a [nextjs-notion-starter-kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit) clone in [Remix.run](https://remix.run/), specifically to use as my own personal site.
